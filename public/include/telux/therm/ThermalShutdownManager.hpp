/**
 * @file       ThermalShutdownManager.hpp
 *
 * @brief      When the chipset temperature reaches a critical level, automatic shutdown of entire
 *             system is triggered to avoid permanent damage. However, applications like eCall may
 *             require to prevent such shutdown during their operation.
 *             When a client disables automatic shutdown, the system internally starts a timer for
 *             auto-enablement. Upon timer expiry, the system notifies the clients and enables the
 *             automatic shutdown after the notified imminent duration.
 *             IThermalShutdownManager class provides APIs to enable/disable automatic thermal
 *             shutdown and receive relevant notifications.
