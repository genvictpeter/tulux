# Using Remote SIM Reference Apps

This section describes how to use the provided Remote SIM reference apps â€“ remote-sim-daemon and
sap-card-provider. The remote-sim-daemon app will run on the device without a SIM, while the
sap-card-provider app will run on the device with a SIM. The two apps will communicate over a
standard IP Ethernet connection, providing the WWAN capabilities of the remote SIM card to the
device without a SIM inserted. Both devices are required to have support for the Telematics SDK and
to be connected to each other via Ethernet.

### Required Items

It is assumed that both devices are configured to enable the necessary features to support Remote
SIM capabilities.

### 1. Set Up the Ethernet connection

First, connectivity between the two devices needs to be established.

##### 1.1 Disable Automatic Configuration IP Address

Depending on the device type, it may be necessary to first disable the auto-config IP (169.254.x.x)
address on both devices.

~~~~~~
brctl delif bridge0 eth0
~~~~~~

##### 1.2 Configure the IP Address on Both Devices

~~~~~~
ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.2
~~~~~~

The device with a SIM can use 192.168.1.3.

NOTE: Depending on the device, it may be necessary to execute steps 1.1 and 1.2 again whenever
either device restarts or is disconnected, due to auto-config settings.

### 2. Run the Remote SIM Daemon in the Background on the Device Without a SIM

~~~~~~
remote-sim-daemon &
~~~~~~

The -d and -s flags can also be used for debugging purposes (use -h for usage instructions).

### 3. Run the Sap Card Provider on the Device with a SIM

~~~~~~
sap-card-provider -i 192.168.1.2
~~~~~~

Use the -i flag to provide the IP address of the device running remote-sim-daemon. The -d and -s
flags can also be used for debugging purposes (use -h for usage instructions).
